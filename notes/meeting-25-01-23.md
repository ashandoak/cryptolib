# Crypto formal proofs meeting

## Jan. 25, 2023

### Questions
- Is the definition on pg. 339 of Boneh and Shoup the best foundation for binding and hiding?
- Statistical = Perfect = Unconditional hiding / binding?
- Why are the schemes on pg. 341 of Boneh and Shoup computationally binding and unconditionally hiding? What sets this scheme apart from the scheme on pg. 336 and pg. 87?
- Can we draw something like figure 2.6 (pg. 35) for our specific purposes?
